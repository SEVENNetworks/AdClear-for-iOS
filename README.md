# AdClear for iOS

Block ads in Safari with AdClear Plus, and browse safer, faster, and more securely.

AdClear Plus is an extension for Safari that keeps ads from ruining your browsing experience. We let Safari know what to block ahead of time, which shrinks the size of websites, saving you data and speeding up loading times.

## Features
* Ad Blocking - Tired of ads everywhere? So are we.
* Filters - Our ad blocking filters update daily with the latest advancements in ad blocking.
* Privacy - AdClear Plus blocks trackers that follow you from site-to-site.
* Speed - Taking ads out of the equation makes pages load much faster and lowers your data use.
* Easy setup - AdClear Plus takes just seconds to enable, and youâ€™ll be blocking ads worry-free!
